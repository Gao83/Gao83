     <span><p>Re_educ is a web application designed to make available to users a wide range of courses taught by professionals from various fields of knowledge. The basic idea is that users with a professional role can register interactive courses that are available to all those interested. It is the professionals themselves who decide the value of the course, thus generating a wide academic offer that allows users the most convenient choice. </p></span>
